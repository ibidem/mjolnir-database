Versioning Conventions
======================

Paradox versions are in the form `x.y.z` where:

 - `z` represents a fix to a previous migration or very minor adjustment that
   is unlikely to affect other channels that may have binded columns or any
   other kind of dependencies to the current tables

 - `y` represents an addition to the system; as with `z` only changes that
   cause low probability of interference with other channels

 - `x` represents changes to current system that is not a minor correction of
   something that was meant with a previous migration (ie. not `z`) or a change
   that is likely to cause interference with other channels dependent on the
   current channel

The `x` qualifier can be any size, `z` should be between 0 and 999, `y` should
be between 0 and 99. It should be rare for the limits to be reached but it's
important to keep them in mind since the system will convert the version to
integers internally for use in certain operations (including history
resolution), and exceeding them, however unlikely, will cause errors.
